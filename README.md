# imaystilllikemyex

**imaystilllikemyex** is a whimsical Next.js project where users can take a lighthearted chance to express lingering feelings for their ex-partners. The application provides a simple form to input your first name, last name, email, and a heartfelt (or humorous) message. But here's the twist: there's only a **1 in 1000 chance** that the message actually goes through upon submission.
